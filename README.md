## Hi, I'm Sunetra. I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering at SRM University.

## I'm actively looking for opportunities where I can grow, contribute and work on impactful projects. Always open to networking with like minded people :)

## Outside of work, I'm either painting or getting lost in a good book -- because who needs a social life when you've got a good plot twist, right?
